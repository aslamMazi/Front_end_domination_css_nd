## Features ðŸŒŸ

This project demonstrates the following HTML and CSS skills:

- Using semantic elements such as `<head>`, `<body>`, `<div>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<img>`.
- Using selectors and properties to style the elements, such as `*`, `html`, `body`, `#main`, `#left`, `#right`, etc.
- Using flexbox to create a responsive layout, such as `display: flex`, `flex-direction: column`, `justify-content: space-between`, etc.
- Using colors, fonts, borders, and backgrounds to enhance the appearance, such as `background-color`, `color`, `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `border`, `border-radius`, etc.
- Using transform and rotate to create a rotated text, such as `transform-origin`, `rotate`, etc.
- Using object-fit to adjust the image size, such as `object-fit: cover`, etc.

## Future Work ðŸ”®

This project is still under development and will be updated in the future. Some of the planned improvements are:

- Making the web page responsive for both small and large screens, using media queries and breakpoints.
- Adding some JavaScript functionality to make the web page more interactive, such as validating the user input, updating the shopping cart, and displaying a confirmation message.
- Adding more products and categories to the web page, using a database and a server.
